Welcome to the 589 utility software!

check out the Source folder for the code and the Final folder for the compiled jar

## Changes:

09/22/19: (hopefully stable)

 - Small update here, just a stable build before I begin new work

09/15/19: (The pretty color update)

 - Flux Class added!
 
 - This is a class that lets you cycle through the colors of the rainbow.  Create a new Flux and call Flux() to get the next color in the cycle, or use Flux(int) to get that many colors down the cycle
  
 - Path drawing added, the FieldCanvas now holds a list of paths which they will draw
